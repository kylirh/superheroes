# A Fun Superhero React App!
This is a fun little React project. Here's what we are going to do:

1. Begin with a static list of at least 5 users, each one should have an id, full name, an office, and a status (active or inactive).  Store this information in an appropriate object.

2. Create a page to list these users - the default sort order is alphabetically by name.

3. The user list should be sortable by name and office

4. The user list should be filterable by status

5. Each user should have a checkbox to the left of their data

6. The page should have a button called "Email Users"

7. When the button is clicked, the page collects the info of the users who were selected by the checkbox and adds a simple form to the page with a textbox labeled "Subject" and a textarea labeled "Message".

8. On successful filling in of the form, and clicking of an "Email" button, do an alert on the page with the recipients, subject, and message shown. (Don't worry about actually sending off emails)

9. Make the app not look ugly.

10. Write some unit tests! Maybe do this first.
